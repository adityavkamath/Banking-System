# Bank Management System

This is a simple bank management system implemented in Java using JDBC for database interaction. It allows bank employees to perform operations such as opening new accounts, viewing existing account data, and registering ATM agencies. Users can also perform transactions like depositing and withdrawing money.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Database Server
- MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver)

## Setup

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Install and configure MySQL Database Server.
   - Create a new database named `bank`.
   - Create a table named `customer_accounts` with columns `account_number` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT), `name` (VARCHAR), and `balance` (DOUBLE).

2. **JDBC Driver**:
   - Download the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
   - Add the JDBC driver JAR file to your project's classpath.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Open the `Main.java` file located in the `com.example.demo` package.
   - Update the following constants to match your MySQL database configuration:
     - `JDBC_URL`: JDBC URL of your MySQL database (`jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bank`).
     - `USERNAME`: Your MySQL username.
     - `PASSWORD`: Your MySQL password.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform bank employee operations or user transaction operations.

## Features

- **Bank Employee Operations**:
  - Open New Account: Allows bank employees to open a new customer account with an initial balance of 0.0.
  - Open Existing Data: Displays the existing customer accounts stored in the database.
  - Register ATM Agency: Placeholder for registering ATM agencies (can be customized further).

- **User Transaction Operations**:
  - Do Transaction: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
  - Withdraw Money: Allows users to withdraw money from their account.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors related to database connection or SQL queries, double-check your MySQL database configuration and ensure that the JDBC URL, username, and password are correct.

- If you face issues with JDBC driver loading or classpath, make sure the JDBC driver JAR file is correctly added to your project's classpath.
